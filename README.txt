TOTARA SEEDLINGS 2.7
====================

Totara Seedlings is a developer-only, open edition of
Totara LMS released as a way of sharing our latest code
and innovations with the community.

Totara Seedlings includes beta code and experimental
features. Seedlings is NOT suitable for running in a
production environment and is not supported.

For a production installation we strongly recommend
the Totara LMS Enterprise edition to receive stable
releases via the Software Update Service including
ticketed technical support and bug fixes (including
security fixes).

QUICK INSTALL
=============

For the impatient, here is a basic outline of the
installation process, which normally takes me only
a few minutes:

1) Move the Totara files into your web directory.

2) Create a single database for Totara to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

3) Visit your Totara site with a browser, you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Totara, creating an admin account etc.

4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so.

code root directory

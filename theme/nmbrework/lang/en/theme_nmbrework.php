<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is the Synergy Learning Responsive base theme. It is a modified Moodle bootstrap theme which inherits styles and renderers from its parent theme.</p>
<p>It includes a few extra bits of styling to bring you what we think is the best experience for a responsive moodle theme.</p>
<p>It has no settings for custom logos and custom css because it doesn\'t need to</p>
<h3>Parents</h3>
<p>This theme is based upon the Bootstrap theme, which was created for Moodle 2.5</p>

UPGRADING A MOODLE SITE TO TOTARA
=================================

Warning: Totara Seedlings is NOT suitable for running in production. See README.txt for more details.

These instructions detail the process for upgrading a Moodle site to Totara.

New requirements in Totara 2.7:

* PHP version 5.4.4 required.
* PHP zlib and OPcache modules now recommended.
* MariaDB 5.5.31 now required (was 5.3.5 in Totara 2.6).

NOTE: Additional plugins, custom themes or customised Moodle code are likely to
    cause conflicts in the upgrade process.
    Review possible conflicts before upgrading to prevent site stability issues.

    As of Totara 2.7 you can no longer upgrade from versions of Moodle prior to 2.2.11.
    Ensure the Moodle site is updated to Moodle version 2.2.11+ before upgrading to Totara 2.7.

    For more information see http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading

1.  Check the live logs to check if any users are currently using the site.
    The site will be offline while the upgrades are performed.
    Reports -> Live Logs

2.  Enable maintenance mode in Moodle.
    Server -> Maintenance Mode

3.  Backup the Moodle database.

4.  Backup the moodledata directory.

5.  Backup the Moodle source code directory.

6a. If your Moodle site is not customised you can replace your moodle code
    folder with the new moodle code folder and copy your old config.php file
    to the new folder.

6b. If you have customised moodle you will need to merge your existing Moodle
    source code and new Totara code. This is best accomplished using a version
    control tool like GIT or SVN. You will need to:
    - Reuse the existing Moodle's config.php file
    - Ensure any themes are updated to work with Totara
    - Include any existing modules and filters remain in the code
    - Resolve any merge conflicts caused by existing local customisations

7.  Navigate to admin/index.php using a web browser and perform the install process.

8.  Click Yes on the Upgrade page.

9. Confirm the server status checks.

10. Confirm the plugin status checks.

11. Proceed with the initial database upgrades.

12. Edit the New Admin Settings page if required.

13. Continue the database upgrades.

14. Check for Warnings or Errors on the upgrade review page.

15. Edit the New Site Settings page if required.

16. Test the site functionality. The site should now be displayed with the
    Totara logos and theme.

17. Disable server maintenance mode.

18. Congratulations, your site is now running Totara.
